      <p>
        Hi there my name is Shawki Haifa and I am a coder in training and i hope
        to graduate. Florida has been my home for the past 10 years. Graduated
        from high school and went to colllege and finished. Coding is something
        new but hopefully we will be able to enjoy it. When i work with people i
        like to get to know everyone and learn new things about them.
